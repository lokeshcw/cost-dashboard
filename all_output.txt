Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `AWSClient` class:
   - Purpose: This class will handle the communication with the AWS API to retrieve pricing information.
   - Methods:
     - `get_instance_pricing(instance_type: str, region: str) -> float`: Retrieves the pricing for a specific instance type in a given region.
     - `get_bucket_pricing(region: str) -> float`: Retrieves the pricing for an S3 bucket in a given region.

2. `CostPredictor` class:
   - Purpose: This class will handle the prediction of costs based on the provided details.
   - Methods:
     - `predict_rds_cost(start_date: datetime, end_date: datetime, region: str, instance_type: str) -> float`: Predicts the cost of an RDS instance based on the start date, end date, region, and instance type.
     - `predict_instance_cost(start_date: datetime, end_date: datetime, region: str, instance_type: str) -> float`: Predicts the cost of an EC2 instance based on the start date, end date, region, and instance type.
     - `predict_bucket_cost(region: str) -> float`: Predicts the cost of an S3 bucket based on the region.

3. `Dashboard` class:
   - Purpose: This class will handle the GUI dashboard functionality.
   - Methods:
     - `display()`: Displays the GUI dashboard.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.

**aws_client.py**
```python
import boto3

class AWSClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pricing_client = boto3.client('pricing', region_name='us-east-1')

    def get_instance_pricing(self, instance_type: str, region: str) -> float:
        # Implement the logic to retrieve instance pricing from AWS API
        # Return the pricing for the specified instance type and region
        pass

    def get_bucket_pricing(self, region: str) -> float:
        # Implement the logic to retrieve bucket pricing from AWS API
        # Return the pricing for the specified region
        pass
```

**cost_predictor.py**
```python
from datetime import datetime

class CostPredictor:
    def __init__(self, aws_client):
        self.aws_client = aws_client

    def predict_rds_cost(self, start_date: datetime, end_date: datetime, region: str, instance_type: str) -> float:
        # Implement the logic to predict RDS cost based on start date, end date, region, and instance type
        # Use the AWSClient to retrieve pricing information
        pass

    def predict_instance_cost(self, start_date: datetime, end_date: datetime, region: str, instance_type: str) -> float:
        # Implement the logic to predict EC2 instance cost based on start date, end date, region, and instance type
        # Use the AWSClient to retrieve pricing information
        pass

    def predict_bucket_cost(self, region: str) -> float:
        # Implement the logic to predict S3 bucket cost based on region
        # Use the AWSClient to retrieve pricing information
        pass
```

**dashboard.py**
```python
from tkinter import Tk, Label, Button

class Dashboard:
    def __init__(self, cost_predictor):
        self.cost_predictor = cost_predictor

    def display(self):
        # Implement the GUI dashboard using a framework like Tkinter or Django
        # Add labels, input fields, and buttons to input the necessary details and display the predicted costs
        pass
```

**main.py**
```python
from aws_client import AWSClient
from cost_predictor import CostPredictor
from dashboard import Dashboard

aws_client = AWSClient()
cost_predictor = CostPredictor(aws_client)
dashboard = Dashboard(cost_predictor)

dashboard.display()
```

In this implementation, we have separate files for the AWS client, cost predictor, and dashboard. The `main.py` file serves as the entry point and initializes the necessary objects to display the dashboard. The `AWSClient` class handles the communication with the AWS API to retrieve pricing information. The `CostPredictor` class predicts the costs based on the provided details and uses the `AWSClient` to retrieve pricing information. The `Dashboard` class handles the GUI functionality using a framework like Tkinter or Django.

Please note that the code provided is a skeleton implementation and requires further development to handle the actual logic and GUI implementation.
